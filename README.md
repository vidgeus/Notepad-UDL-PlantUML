# A Notepad++ UDL for PlantUML language
This project is to contain a user definied language (UDL) for Notepad++ to support the PlantUML language syntax.
It is not a perfect solution as UDL does not support regexes so some PlantUML constructs (like coloured swimlanes) could not be matched.

How to import a UDL into your Notepad++:
